          OUR MISSION The Lincoln Elementary School Parent-Teacher Organization
          (PTO) is an approved Non-Profit Organization under Internal Revenue
          Code, Section 501(c)(3). Our mission is to establish school and family
          interaction and nurture a close relationship between the parents,
          teachers, and students by providing social opportunities both inside
          and outside the classroom. Our PTO has sponsored fundraisers which
          help fund events such as the Harvest Festival, Breakfast with Frosty,
          Skate Night, and the very popular Fun Day! We have also helped raise
          funds for technology growth like the addition of IPADs for our younger
          grade students. We fund the student folder program, provide assistance
          to teachers in classroom settings for class parties, supplement
          student field trip transportation, support school and family social
          interaction, and provide a non-biased forum for sharing information on
          issues that impact our children. In addition, we fund two scholarships
          to former Lincoln Elementary School students who graduate Edison High
          School each year. It is our belief that the team effort of a parent
          teacher organization offers the best possible learning environment for
          our children.
