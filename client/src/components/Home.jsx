              On behalf of the Lincoln Elementary PTO, welcome to the 2023-2024
              school year!{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              For those of you who are new to Lincoln, we are looking forward to
              meeting you and helping you become a part of the school community!
              Together we can show our children that they are valued and loved
              by providing them with a fun-filled and enriching year.
            </p>
            <p>
              For those returning parents, we thank you for your ongoing support
              without which we would not be able to continue to provide a
              supportive and positive environment for our students. The ability
              of our PTO to supplement our childrenâ€™s day-to-day instruction is
              a result of the commitment and efforts of ALL its members, and we
              simply cannot do it without you.
