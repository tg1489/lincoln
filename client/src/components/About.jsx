        OUR MISSION The Lincoln Elementary School Parent-Teacher Organization
        (PTO) is an approved Non-Profit Organization under Internal Revenue
        Code, Section 501(c)(3). Our mission is to establish school and family
        interaction and nurture a close relationship between the parents,
        teachers, and students by providing social opportunities both inside and
        outside the classroom. Our PTO has sponsored fundraisers which help fund
        events such as the Harvest Festival, Breakfast with Frosty, Skate Night,
        and the very popular Fun Day! We have also helped raise funds for
        technology growth like the addition of IPADs for our younger grade
        students. We fund the student folder program, provide assistance to
        teachers in classroom settings for class parties, supplement student
        field trip transportation, support school and family social interaction,
        and provide a non-biased forum for sharing information on issues that
        impact our children. In addition, we fund two scholarships to former
        Lincoln Elementary School students who graduate Edison High School each
        year. It is our belief that the team effort of a parent teacher
        organization offers the best possible learning environment for our
        children.
